# hangman_game

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python.

How to Play
A random word is selected from a predefined list.

You have a limited number of incorrect guesses (6).

For each round:

A stickman figure is drawn to represent your incorrect guesses.

You guess one letter at a time.

If you guess correctly, the letter appears in the word.

If you guess incorrectly, the hangman figure progresses.

The game ends when:
